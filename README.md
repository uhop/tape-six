tape6 is a [TAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol)-based library for unit tests. It is written in modern ES6 and works in [node](https://nodejs.org/), [deno](https://deno.land/) and browsers.

The documentation is TBD but you can inspect `tests/` to see how it is used.
If you are familiar with other TAP-based libraries you'll feel right at home.
