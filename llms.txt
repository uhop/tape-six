# tape-six

> A TAP-based unit testing library for modern JavaScript (ES6+). Works in Node, Deno, Bun, and browsers. Runs ES modules natively, supports TypeScript without transpilation. The npm package name is `tape-six` but all internal names use `tape6`.

- Minimal, zero-dependency test library with a familiar API
- Test files are directly executable: `node test.js`, `bun run test.js`, `deno run -A test.js`
- Parallel test execution via worker threads
- TAP, TTY (colored), and JSONL output formats
- Browser testing with built-in web UI and automation support (Puppeteer, Playwright)
- Before/after hooks: `beforeAll`, `afterAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`
- `test()` is aliased as `suite()`, `describe()`, and `it()` for easy migration
- Compatible with `AssertionError`-based libraries like `node:assert` and `chai`
